This repository contains information about lessons from linear algebra and calculus that are useful for the practicing data scientist. It was designed for pedagogical purposes.

Here are some rules for constructing derivatives:

# Derivative Rules

Here is a list of rules for some common derivative patterns.

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[cf(x)] = cf'(x)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n - 1}$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[sin(x)] = cos(x)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[cos(x)] = -sin(x)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[a^x] = a^xln(a)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[log_bx)] = \frac{1}{xln(b)}$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f'(x) + g'(x)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)g(x)] = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)$

$\large\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f(x)}{(g(x)}\right] = \frac{g(x)f'(x) - f(x)g'(x))}{(g(x))^2}$
